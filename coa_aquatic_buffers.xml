<abstract>This polygon feature class represents POTENTIAL aquatic buffers as required by City of Asheville's NPDES Phase II permit held with N.C. DENR - Division of Water Quality.  This feature class serves as a representation of potential aquatic buffers utilizing information from the N.C. Stream Mapping program as a surrogate for NRCS drainage lines (which currently are not digital and in some cases unavailable).  The requirement for an aquatic buffer will be determined through a field visit to each site, in combination with a cross-referencing of the NRCS field sheets (if available) and USGS 7.5' Quadrangle maps as authoritative mapping resources for intermittent and perennial streams.  The stream or water body MUST BE DECLARED AS JURISDICTIONAL before an aquatic buffer is required.  Additionally, the actual aquatic buffer would be enforced through field measurements rather than through any GIS product as the buffers' extent is dependent upon the position of top-of-bank along the stream.  Currently, City of Asheville does not have top-of-bank information for most properties.  All application of buffer requirements may be subject to additional minimum criteria such as lot size, amount of disturbed area, etc.  Please contact the City of Asheville Stormwater Services Division @ (828) 232-4567 for further information regarding any questions related to aquatic buffer requirements or applicability.</abstract>

<logic>Topologicaly clean.  This multi-part polygon feature class corresponds with 'streams' and modeled drainage mapped by the N.C. Stream Mapping Program in 2006/2007.  The polygons do not represent actual aquatic buffers required by the Stormwater Services Division of the City of Asheville Transportation and Engineering Department.  The source hydrography (NC CGIA Streams) does not represent ground-truthed drainage or conveyance information and has not been verified for stream delineation quality.  The polygons correspond directly with the source data 'as mapped' and have been clipped to the May 2008 City of Asheville Jurisdictional Boundaries.</logic>
<complete>Complete per the 2007 release of N.C. Stream Mapping Program Data.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>Per documentation provided by the N.C. Stream Mapping Program available @ http://www.ncstreams.org/.  All buffers were constructed using the source hydrography in ArcGIS-ArcMap 9.1.  For reaches or polyline features that had prexisting representation in the USGS 24k hydrography (NHD), a 40' buffer was used to compensate for potentially larger channel widths (to provide a conservative estimate from the top-of-bank).  All other reaches and water body polygons were buffered @ 30'.</horizpar>

<procstep>
<procdesc>The N.C. CGIA Streams and Water Bodies were selected within a 200' buffer of the current City of Asheville Jurisdictional Boundaries.  These features were buffered by 30', the exception being reaches that were previously represnted in the USGS 24k NHD, which were buffered by 40' to compensate for potentially larger channel widths .  After all buffers were created, they were unioned together and dissolved to create a single multi-part feature representing potential aquatic buffers.  The polygons were then clipped to the current City of Asheville Jurisdictional boundaries.</procdesc>
